I would that we were, my beloved, white birds on the foam of the sea!
We tire of the flame of the meteor, before it can fade and flee;
And the flame of the blue star of twilight, hung low on the rim of the sky,
Has awaked in our hearts, my beloved, a sadness that may not die.

A weariness comes from those dreamers, dew-dabbled, the lily and rose;
Ah, dream not of them, my beloved, the flame of the meteor that goes,
Or the name of the blue star
That lingers hung low in the fall of the dew:
For I would we were changed to white birds on the wandering foam: I and you!

I am haunted by numberless islands, and many a Danaan shore,
Where time would surely forget us, and sorrow come near us no more;
Soon far from the rose and lily and fret of the flames would we be,
Were we only white birds, my beloved, buoyed out on the foam of the sea!

我的愛人啊，我願我們是大海泡沫上的一雙白鳥，
當流星還未消隱時我們就已厭倦了它的光焰；
黃昏的藍星低低地挂在天邊，
我的愛人啊，它的光芒喚醒了我心中永遠不滅的悲傷。
一絲倦意飄來，來自於那些夢幻者，
濕潤的露珠，那百合，那玫瑰；
啊，我的愛人，不要夢幻那些東西，那流星的光輝，
那低懸於露珠中，徘徊流連的藍星的光輝：
我願我們化作漂游的泡沫上的白鳥：你和我！
我心頭盤旋著數不清的海島，還有衆多的妲恩海岸，
那裏，我們全然被時光遺忘，悲哀不再靠近我們；
我們隨即遠離了玫瑰與百合，遠離了惱人的火焰，
衹要我們是白鳥，我的愛人，那大海泡沫中浮起的白鳥！
